There are two ways for inserting a module in kernel.
1. Static 
	In this method, the module can be insterted to the kernel image
	while compiling the kernel.
	
	This way, the source code along with the make file and insertion 
	mechanism has to be in the path $(TOP_DIR)/drivers/ of the 
	project kernel. While cross compiling the kernel, the module will
	be compiled and will be included in the image.
	
	This kind of insertion mechanism has to be accepted if, the driver
	is well tested and prooved with 0% failure rate.
	___________
	Procedure :-
		We have to explore this part and update ourselves by 15th Feb.
	
2. Dynamic
	In dynamic module insertion method, the module can be inserted
	at run time. And will be placed in the ram. In this method we need
	the cross compiled binary file of the module.
	
	More importantly the module has to be cross compiled individually 
	with the same cross compiller what has been used for cross compiling
	the kernel.
	__________
	Procedure:-
		After generating the binary(Ex: mod.ko), copy the file to the 
		file system. 
			Ex /.module/exmple_mod.ko
		For insrting the module,
			$insmod ./example_mod.ko
				or
			$modprobe ./example_mod.ko
		For removing the module,
			$rmmod example_mod.ko
				{This command has to be run after inserting a module 
				 otherwise, error will occure.}
	------------------------------
	Add the module to init script.
	------------------------------
		Some specific modules, which has special hardware deependencies,
		need to be inserted at the booting time. For this kind of operations,
		Linux has defined startup and shutdown runlelvel.
		Default run levels are,
			0 – System halt i.e the system can be safely powered off with no activity.
			1 – Single user mode.
			2 – Multiple user mode with no NFS(network file system).
			3 – Multiple user mode under the command line interface and 
				not under the graphical user interface.
			4 – User-definable.
			5 – Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this is 
				the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX based systems.
			6 – Reboot which is used to restart the system.
